<h1> Python awesome scripts </h1>

This repo contain some awesome scripts written in python. These scripts can be developed further to be used in Industries/Business Or can be used for educational purposes.

It contains:
<ul> 
  <h2>Air Cargo Prices</h2>
  <p>Calculates the amount that will be paid by customer to send packages to different wordwide locations. Price depends on several factors. the most important one is the distance the package will go through.</p>

   <h2>Roll Dice Sum</h2>

     <p>Student & Class classes show the relationship between the two class and how you can call useful functions that will give you the exam grades, avargae class score, etc of each student and of the whole class.</p>

<h3>I will be updating this repo regularly with awesome python scripts and programs. Stay tuned!</3>
